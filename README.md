In order to run this app you need to have fresh enough version of Docker installed. I was using v4.22.1.

In order to start services please run `docker-compose up â€”-build` from repository root.

In browser go to http://localhost:8000/docs#/

Have fun with APIs.

Topics to discuss during next call:
